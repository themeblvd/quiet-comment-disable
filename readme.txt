Quietly disable comments to avoid unwanted comment spam.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that allows you to disable comments being submitted to your WordPress site, but still present the natural look of your theme's comment form.

This plugin isn't meant for the average WordPress user, but it's great, for example, if you have a demo site for a WordPress theme. With this plugin activated, people visiting your demo site will be able to preview the look of the comment form of your theme; however, it will not allow anyone to submit a comment. This way, you don't end up with a WordPress theme demo site with a thousand pending comments.

Here's a basic example from our [Jump Start](http://wpjumpstart.com) demo; submit a comment to test:
